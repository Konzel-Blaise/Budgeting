# Budgeting
This is my attempt at creating a mostly automated application that processes and visualizes my expenses on a monthly basis.  

The input to this code is the spending history data exported from Capital One's export as .csv functionality. It is meant to help you better visualize your spending. Features are mainly focused on viewing your spending history as a function of: 

1) Date - when the purchase occured
2) Category - what the purchase was 

This app relies on the functionality of plotly, a python package for viewing python charts in html browser form.
